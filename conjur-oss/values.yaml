# Default values for conjur-oss.


# NOTE: It is recommended that any chart values that contain sensitive
# information (e.g. database.password, database.url, and SSL certificates
# and keys) be set on the command line with a `--set key=value` argument
# rather than setting these in a custom values YAML file. This avoids the
# risk of leaving around residual values files containing this sensitive
# information.
