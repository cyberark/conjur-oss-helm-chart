## Unreleased

### Added
- Support for deploying Conjur OSS to OpenShift 4.6. With the automated tests added in
  [conjurdemos/kubernetes-conjur-demo#110](https://github.com/conjurdemos/kubernetes-conjur-demo/issues/110),
  this helm chart now has [Trusted](https://github.com/cyberark/community/blob/master/Conjur/conventions/certification-levels.md#trusted)
  support for OpenShift.
  [cyberark/conjur-oss-helm-chart#140](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-oss-helm-chart/issues/140)
### Changed
- The default Postgres server version is incremented to 10.16 from 10.15. [Postgres 10.16](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/release-10-16.html)

## [v2.0.3] - 2020-12-30

### Added
- The Conjur OSS helm chart has Community support for deploying Conjur OSS to
  OpenShift 4.x.
  [cyberark/conjur-oss-helm-chart#60](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-oss-helm-chart/issues/60)

### Changed
- The default Postgres server version is incremented to 10.15 from 10.14.
  [cyberark/conjur-oss-helm-chart#120](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-oss-helm-chart/issues/120)

### Fixed
- Conjur pod no longer fails on restarts when the Conjur cluster is helm
  installed with the automatic Conjur account creation feature enabled (e.g.
  with `--set account.create=true`). The Conjur startup command is revised to
  check if the account exists before starting the server with the flag used to
  create it.
  [cyberark/conjur-oss-helm-chart#119](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-oss-helm-chart/issues/119)
- Kubernetes-in-Docker example scripts no longer fail with undefined
  DOCKER_REGISTRY_PATH environment variable error.
  [cyberark/conjur-oss-helm-chart#138](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-oss-helm-chart/issues/138)

## [v2.0.2] - 2020-12-02

### Changed
- Default Conjur version is upgraded from 1.5 to 1.11. Default Postgres
  version is upgraded from 10.12 to 10.14.
  [cyberark/conjur-oss-helm-chart#112](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-oss-helm-chart/issues/112),
  [cyberark/conjur-oss-helm-chart#108](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-oss-helm-chart/issues/108)
- Image `tag` values must now include surrouding quotes when they are
  set in a values.yaml file. Arbitrary tag strings are allowed now
  (e.g. "latest" is allowable).
  [cyberark/conjur-oss-helm-chart#106](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-oss-helm-chart/issues/106)

## [v2.0.1] - 2020-10-30

### Added
- `CONJUR_LOG_LEVEL` for the Conjur container can now be configured by setting the
  `logLevel` value, or updated using `helm upgrade` [cyberark/conjur-oss-helm-chart#77](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-oss-helm-chart/issues/77)

### Changed
- `account` now accepts two values, `account.create`, a boolean, and `account.name`, a string. 
  These values allow you to configure the creation of a Conjur account on container startup, and 
  the name of the account. [cyberark/conjur-oss-helm-chart#77](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-oss-helm-chart/issues/78)

### Deprecated
- The `rbac.create` chart value is now deprecated. This value will be replaced in the next major
  release with two separate settings: `rbac.createClusterRole` (defaulting to true) and
  `rbac.createClusterRoleBinding` (defaulting to false). Though `ClusterRole` creation will continue
  to be supported, we recommend users migrate to using `RoleBindings` at application deploy time
  rather than relying on overprivileged `ClusterRoleBindings`.

## [v2.0.0] - 2020-06-18

### Added
- Adds password authentication for the backend Postgres database connection.
- Adds TLS support between the Conjur pod and the Postgres pod.
- Adds default auto-generation of the Postgres connection password and
  TLS certificate.
- Adds default auto-rotation of the following for `helm upgrade`:
  - Conjur TLS CA signing certificate and signed certificate for Conjur
  - Postgres database TLS certificate and key
- Adds mechanism for user to set their own TLS CA and signed certificates
  for Conjur.
 
### Changed
- Pins default Conjur version to current stable release 1.5.
- Sets default pullPolicy for Nginx and Postgres to `Always`.

### Fixed
- Fixes an issue with the use of persistent volume store so that the
  Postgres database contents are preserved across pod resets
  and helm upgrades.
